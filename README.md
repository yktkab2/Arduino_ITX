# Arduino_ITX
This is a basic arduino project that uses lights, lasers and piezo sensors...
So basically this is a sensor system that opens a door using a servo and turns on the led light when its night time, and will just open the door when its the day time.

The project also uses lasers to detect if its and adult or a child outisde a second door.
If it detetcts a child, it turns on a red led light(led) for 20 seconds and sound alarm(piezo).
If an adult is sensed, it opens the door and turns on the green light(led) for 20 seconds.

It will also detect if its day or night time.
